      "\n",
      "Ingredients:\n",
      "- 500g boneless chicken, cut into bite-sized pieces\n",
      "- 1 cup plain yogurt\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons lemon juice\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n",
      "- 1 large onion, finely chopped\n",
      "- 3 cloves of garlic, minced\n",
      "- 1-inch piece of ginger, grated\n",
      "- 2 teaspoons ground cumin\n",
      "- 2 teaspoons ground coriander\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon turmeric powder\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon paprika\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon garam masala\n",
